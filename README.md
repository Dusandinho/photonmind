# photonmind
Accelerate and automate the design of photonic integrated circuits with machine learning.

## About
The PhotonMind platform creates compact, flexible models of photonic devices using numerically solved electromagnetic data and deep artificial neural networks. This allows for orders-of-magnitude faster calculations for device-level optimizations and system-level simulations. PhotonMind is written in MATLAB and uses Lumerical FDTD for backend data acquisition.
