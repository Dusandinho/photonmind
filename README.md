# photonmind
Accelerate the design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with machine learning.

## About
The PhotonMind platform creates compact, flexible models of photonic devices using numerically solved electromagnetic data and deep artificial neural networks (ANNs). This allows for orders-of-magnitude faster calculations for device-level optimizations and system-level simulations.

**PhotonMind is written in MATLAB.**
